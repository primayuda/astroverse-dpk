The dive sites around Komodo are characterized by the complex and fast currents unique to Komodo, created by the intricate terrain consisting of islands surrounded by the Flores Sea from the north, with warm and highly transparent water, and nutrient-rich deep water from the Indian Ocean in the south. This environment gives rise to an unparalleled abundance of marine life, making Komodo home to a rich and diverse underwater ecosystem unlike any other.

Komodo National Park, located in Indonesia, is a world-renowned dive destination celebrated for its stunning marine biodiversity, vibrant coral reefs, and unique underwater landscapes. Here are some of the top dive sites within the park:

Highlights: The sensation of being "shot" through the channel by the current, hence the nickname "Shotgun."  

This is a site that passes through a strait between two islands, Gili Lawadarat and Gili Lawalaut, mainly drifting from north to south during falling tide. Along the way, there is a large fish bowl at a depth of about 23 meters, and after passing through there, the shotgun begins around the area where the depth increases.
