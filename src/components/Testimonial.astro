    testimonial: "We were supposed to dive only once in the Komodos, but the quality of the divespots and Katsu's kindness made us change our mind. Respect the pletoric offer of equivalent services and dive shops in Labuan Bajo, we chose to make the difference on people, and we don't regret it! On top of that they gave us a lot of really usefull informations for our trip in Flores, special thanks to Marian for his precious help. We highly recommand, thanks a lot for everything !

    testimonial: "This dive school is very chilled! Their style is a bit less conservative than ours, but we still had an amazing day. We saw so many turtles, a cuttlefish and 4 mantas! It was a pleasant surprise that they had some nice videos to share with us. As a side business they also rent out scooters here, that you can drop off in Maumere if you want. It's a super convenient and economic option. We rented the scooters with Marian and were super happy with everything! The quality was really good and we enjoyed it so much! I highly recommend exploring Flores on scooter. üõµ",

    testimonial: "The best place for a diver in the world! I did 6 dives in 2 days. They take you in a boat from Labuan Bajo to Komodo National Park to do the dives. The breakfast and the lunch are included, and they were the best meals I tried in the area! The name of Paradise Divers it is a reflection of reality, the best place to dive around the world! I saw all kind of creatures (sharks, manta rayas, dolphins, turtles,‚Ä¶). But the best thing even if it is the best spot to dive in the world is the STAFF!!! The instructors lovely, friendly and willing to make you happy all the time! Thank you Mariano for the management and special thank you to MARC, LUPE and KATSU for being my instructors in one of the best 2 days of my life!",
