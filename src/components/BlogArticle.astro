        <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 dark:text-neutral-200">
          The dive sites around Komodo are characterized by the complex and fast currents unique to Komodo, created by the intricate terrain consisting of islands surrounded by the Flores Sea from the north, with warm and highly transparent water, and nutrient-rich deep water from the Indian Ocean in the south. This environment gives rise to an unparalleled abundance of marine life, making Komodo home to a rich and diverse underwater ecosystem unlike any other.

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 dark:text-neutral-200">
        Komodo National Park, located in Indonesia, is a world-renowned dive destination celebrated for its stunning marine biodiversity, vibrant coral reefs, and unique underwater landscapes.

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 dark:text-neutral-200">Here are some of the top dive sites within the park:</p>

      <div class="space-y-3">
        <p class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 dark:text-neutral-200 ">Batu Bolong</p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 dark:text-neutral-200"><span class="italic">Description:</span> A small rock pinnacle that rises from deep waters, Batu Bolong is famous for its dramatic drop-offs and vibrant coral gardens.</p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 dark:text-neutral-200"><span class="italic">Marine Life:</span> Schools of colorful reef fish, Napoleon wrasse, giant trevally, and occasional sightings of pelagic species like sharks and manta rays.</p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 dark:text-neutral-200"><span class="italic">Highlights:</span> The site offers strong currents that bring nutrient-rich waters, supporting a thriving ecosystem.</p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 dark:text-neutral-200">Batu Bolong is an approximately 80-meter rocky outcrop located between Komodo and Tatawa Islands. The top of the rock is visible from the surface, and depending on the angle, you can observe holes in the rock formations. Divers typically descend from the opposite side of the reef where the current flows and zigzag along both sides of the current, but when the current is weak, it’s also possible to circumnavigate the reef. The density of marine life here is unparalleled among Komodo’s dive sites, giving divers a feeling akin to being in an aquarium. You can observe fish of various sizes, and occasionally spot dolphins.
